A jobcoin wallet to send jobcoins and track your balance while inside a gradient background.

Example address: `dalton`

### set up

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

### notes

This app was fun to build :) I opted to build it on Next to take advantage of the built-in routing and the performance optimizations it provides. I added SASS in there to add mobile breakpoints directly into the CSS module classes.
